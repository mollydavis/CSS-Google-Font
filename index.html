            Palette Mosaic is constructed from primitive shapes by handicapped artists in collaboration with design students. The shapes have been arranged to create a               strong and solid atmosphere.
            This family is part of the Shibuya Font project, a collaboration of design major students and handicapped artist living in Shibuya city, officially                       approved by Shibuya city in Tokyo.

           Red Hat is a family of typefaces produced in 2 optical sizes and this monospace style, each with a range of weights and with italics. The fonts were originally            commissioned by Paula Scher at Pentagram, and designed by Jeremy Mickel at MCKL for a new Red Hat brand identity.

           The Red Hat typefaces are a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic.            The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower            width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together              seamlessly at a range of sizes.

            Smokum is a western inspired slab-serif font with a little playful swagger to it. It's perfect for headlines and display uses that require a little                     loosened up country flair, but because of the contrast of thicks and thins, it will perform best as a WebFont at medium to large point sizes.

            Manrope is an open-source modern sans-serif font family, designed by Mikhail Sharanda in 2018. In 2019, Mirko Velimirovic worked with Mikhail Sharanda to                 convert Manrope into a variable font.

            In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium.From dumpy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go               but up. Bungee is a font family that celebrates urban signage. It wrangles the Latin alphabet to work vertically as well as                                               horizontally.
